        <p>After looking for months for software for my new workshop, IAME pointed me to the Leading Hand. The main benefits were instant : Customer bookings, Invoicing, Customer History; Different programmable inventory items; Easy printing and SMS to customer and emailing of invoices Most importantly it was able to instantly add on to my current MYOB Software without changing any accounts. Overall it's a workshop life changer and I now could not live without it. Thank you. I love my software!!!</p>

        <p>We have used Leading Hand for 14 years now and can say we would recommend this software to anyone working in the automotive industry. When one of our previous employees decided to open his own workshop and the first thing I told him was to run Leading Hand. Everyone you deal with is helpful and speaks English not techno. We would be lost without the great history aspect of Leading Hand and all our mechanics have no trouble using the software.</p>

        <p>We do a lot of work with trucks and heavy vehicles and love the vehicle history. For us, this goes back more than 20 years to when we first got Leading Hand. When customers bring up an issue, it is easy to check when work was performed. We also like being able to record when service is due. This feature is great, especially as some vehicles are repaired on-site and we can check when an item service is required.</p>

        <p>We looked at many workshop packages and decided The Leading Hand was the best. That was more than 20 years ago. Since then The Leading Hand has gone from strength to strength, improving the professionalism of our workshop management along the way. It is a long-term relationship that has paid big dividends. I'm glad we made that decision.</p>
