<h1>Leading Hand can help your business</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        By using The Leading Hand the office is easier to run,<br />
        jobs are better organised and the workshop can concentrate<br />
        on cars, trucks, heavy machinery, transmissions,<br />
        or whatever the main focus of your business may be.
    </p>
    <p>
        All of which means, when you leave at the end of the<br />
        day, or take that dream holiday, you know your<br />
        business is functioning well.

    <p>Easy to understand and put to use. We'd recommend it to anyone looking for workshop software.</p>

    <p>The Leading Hand is great. I've had the multi-user licence for several years and it is a vital part of my business. The Quick Invoices are particularly useful.</p>

    <p>The Leading Hand is an excellent product. The fact I have been using it for 20 years speaks for itself on how good the program is. It has been the backbone of our business. I have recommended it to many of my colleagues.</p>

    We really like how Leading Hand has improved communication between the office and the workshop. It saves so much time and means everyone knows what is going on.
